Title: Hypercubic (hidden) Markov model inference of accumulation processes
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Iain Johnston and Marcus Moen
Maintainer: Iain Johnston <aeioun@gmail.com>
Description: Inference of the transition probabilities on a hypercubic transition network given some observations of emitted signals from a (hidden) Markov model on that network. Visualisations of the inferred parameterised model and its summary dynamics are also performed.
